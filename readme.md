**No Phone Zone** is a real-time web-based AI application that helps users stay focused by detecting mobile phones in the camera frame. Using **TensorFlow.js** and the **COCO-SSD** model, it triggers an audio alarm whenever a phone is detected.

> **Privacy Focused:** All detection happens directly in your browser. No video data is sent to any server.
